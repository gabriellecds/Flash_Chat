# Flash Chat App

With this App I was able to learn about one of the most fundamental components of modern iOS applications, the Table View. Table Views are used everywhere, from email to messaging apps. It's a crucial part of every iOS developer's toolkit. I also learned how to create custom cells and create my own cloud-based backend database. 

Flash Chat is a web-based messaging app similar to WhatsApp, the popular messaging app that was bought by Facebook for 22 billion dollars. I used a service called Firebase Firestore as a backend database to store and retrieve the messages from the cloud. 

With this application I was also able to learn about View Controller Lifecycle, as well as Application Lifecyle, topics that are also very important for iOS developers. In short, I was able to learn: 

* How to integrate third party libraries in my app using Cocoapods and Swift Package Manager.
* How to store data in the cloud using Firebase Firestore.
* How to query and sort the Firebase database.
* How to use Firebase for user authentication, registration and login.
* How to work with UITableViews and how to set their data sources and delegates.
* How to create custom views using .xib files to modify native design components.
* How to embed View Controllers in a Navigation Controller and understand the navigation stack.
* How to create a constants file and use static properties to store Strings and other constants.
* Learn about Swift loops and create animations using loops.
* Learn about the App Lifecycle and how to use viewWillAppear or viewWillDisappear.
* How to create direct Segues for navigation.
